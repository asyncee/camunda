Prototype of a python client for Camunda BPM

Features:

- Simple and easy to use API
- Support for both synchronous/asynchronous requests via `HTTPX`
- Type hints for 100% of a codebase
- No dictionaries â€” all requests and responses are data transfer objects built with `Pydantic`

State of a project: prototype. Project structure and base API is defined, but there
is currently only one endpoint implemented, see examples directory.
